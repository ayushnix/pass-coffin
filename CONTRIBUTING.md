[pass-coffin](https://github.com/ayushnix/pass-coffin) better, please ensure that

- your bash code doesn't trigger errors or warnings from
  [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)

  if you've used `# shellcheck disable` in your bash code, there should be a very good reason for it

- your bash code has been formatted using [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) with the following
  settings

  `-i 2 -ci -sr -bn`

Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/ayushnix/pass-coffin/issues/new/choose) if you have any
